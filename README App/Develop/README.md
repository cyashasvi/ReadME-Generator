# Application: README Generator

  
 Description: The application will create a README file for the user's application based on the input he has put in. The goal was to create something that could be used to generate a README every time I would work on a project or create an app without having to constantly create a README from scratch. I wasn't able to get the licensing to work, because I wasn't sure where I should have been pulling that data from. In the future, I would love to fix that and work on building out licensing and a table of contents for my README file.  

  
 Usage: This application can be used by cloning the repo off of GitHub, and then by running the application via powershell or Git Bash through node. Node will activiate the application, and then you would go about answering all the questions which in turn will create your README file. 

  
 Contribution: People can contribute to this application by cloning the repo and then by merging with the main branch. The goal here would be to create a README generator that also does licensing as well as creating a table of contents for better access for longer README's. 

  
  Testing: There are no testing requirements.
